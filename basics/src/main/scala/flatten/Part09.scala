  // Most well-known typeclasses in Play are the ones for JSON: Reads, Writes and Format
  // Play provides some `instances` of them: Format[String], Reads[DateTime], etc.
  // You can define `instances` of these type classes for your own classes.

  // Exercise: without looking at the previous part, create a type class `Serializable`, a function `toBytes` that impicitly uses this
  // typeclass, and instances for `Int` and `String`.
